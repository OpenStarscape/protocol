## Background

The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), part of the Internet protocol suite, is a very popular reliable bidirectional stream protocol, used very heavily on the Internet.

Transport Layer Security (TLS), formerly known as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), is a security protocol often used in combination with TCP.

Unix-domain `SOCK_STREAM` sockets are an inter-process communication mechanism in Unix-like operating systems.

## Specification

This specification provides a session layer that sits between any of the above-described stream transports and the Changeable Properties Protocol.

All messages must be converted to datagrams by serializing them with no newlines. Every datagram is terminated by exactly one newline and sent to the stream. This entire process is reversed on the receiving end.
