## Introduction

**This document is an early draft.**

The OpenStarscape core is a specialization of the Changeable Properties Protocol that provides object types and commands to represent the monitoring and operation of a spacecraft in a 3D environment.

The entire Changeable Properties Protocol specification and all associated session-layer specifications are incorporated by reference.

## General behavior

The specialization name is `"OpenStarscape v1"`

Until the client sends a `connect` message, no objects except the `universe` are available.

## Client messages

The following are legal messages that the client may sent to the server, in addition to those specified by the base Changeable Properties Protocol.

### `connect`

Specify a vessel to connect to.

* `vessel`: String; identifier of the vessel.
* `credential`: Any; credentials proving authorization to connect to the vessel.

### `waypoint`

Create a new `point` object.

The status message must include, if successful, a field `object` with the identifier of the new `point`, whose `pos` property must be settable.

## Object types

### `point`

A point in space. Version 1.

* `pos`: Object containing numbers; the `x`, `y`, and `z` coordinates of the point's position in megameters. May or may not be settable.

### `orientedpoint`

A point in space with an orientation. Version 1.

* All properties of `point`.
* `quatorient`: Object containing numbers; the `n`, `i`, `j`, and `k` components of a rotation quaternion describing the point's orientation relative to "up" being towards the positive Z-axis while facing the positive X-axis. May or may not be settable.
* `axangorient`: Object containing numbers; the `eliv` and `azim` angles of a unit vector and the `roll` angle of the angle-axis representation, all measured in radians, describing the point's orientation relative to "up" being towards the positive Z-axis while facing the positive X-axis. May or may not be settable.

### `body`

A physical object in space. Version 1.

* All properties of `point`.
* `vel`: Object containing numbers; the `x`, `y`, and `z` components of the body's velocity vector in megameters per second. Not settable.

### `rotatingbody`

* All properties of `orientedpoint`.
* All properties of `body`.
* `quatrotate`: Object containing numbers; the `n`, `i`, `j`, and `k` components of a rotation quaternion describing the body's orientation change per second relative. Not settable.
* `axangrotate`: Object containing numbers; the `eliv` and `azim` angles of a unit vector and the `roll` angle of the angle-axis representation, all measured in radians per second, describing the body's orientation change relative to "up" being towards the positive Z-axis while facing the positive X-axis. Not settable.

### `poweredbody`

An object in space under power. Version 1.

* All properties of `rotatingbody`.
* `accel`: Object containing numbers; the `x`, `y`, and `z` components of the body's acceleration vector in megameters per second per second. May or may not be settable.
* `quatdeltarotate`: Object containing numbers; the `n`, `i`, `j`, and `k` components of a rotation quaternion describing the body's delta-orientation change per second per second. Not settable.
* `axangdeltarotate`: Object containing numbers; the `eliv` and `azim` angles of a unit vector and the `roll` angle of the angle-axis representation, all measured in radians per second per second, describing the body's delta-orientation change. Not settable.
